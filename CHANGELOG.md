## 💅 Polish

## 🚀 New features

-   Events can now be turned into IObservables making it possible to subscribe to them. this also makes Atoms compatible with UniRx.

# 1.0.0 (Mars 17, 2019)

-   Unity Atoms is now using UPM (Unity Package Manager) - see the README on the new and improved way to use and depend on Unity Atoms
-   Conditional Functions - Check a condition before executing an action.
-   Molecules - Larger constructs / sets of atoms and other ScriptableObjects. First Molecule added is the Timer.
-   Moved editor scripts to separate folder
-   Rearranged the structure of Unity Atoms. Scripts are now on the highest level separated on type (int, float, etc.) instead of on concept (Game Event, Variables, etc.). This seems like a more natural way of structuring the project and makes it easier for developers to include / exclude the relevant stuff for their project.
-   New type called TouchUserInput that keeps track of a user’s touch input. There is also a possibility to detect tap / double tap.
-   Added new MonoHooks, for example OnPointerDownHook, OnButtonClickHook, OnTriggerStay and OnTriggerEnter.
