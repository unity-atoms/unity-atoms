  "description": "There is still an issue that the HealthBar.cs script is in charge of registering itself as a listener and at the same time defining what happens when a Event is raised. We need to seperate its concerns! This brings us to the third concept of Unity Atoms, Listeners. A Listener listens (sometimes also referred to as observes or subscribes) to an Event and responds by firing off zero to many responses. Listeners are MonoBehaviours and therefore live in a scene. They can be seen as the glue between Events and Actions.",
