  "description": "The ChangeFillAmount function created in the listeners tutorial is actually a Response of type UnityEvent. However, in Unity Atoms there is also the possibility to create Responses as Scriptable Objects called Actions. An Action is a function as a Scriptable Object that does not return a value. As a side note there are also Functions in Unity Atoms, which are exactly like Actions, but does return a value. To demonstrate the concept of an Action as a Response lets create an Action called HealthLogger.cs that gives some love to the console and logs the player’s health whenever it changes:",
