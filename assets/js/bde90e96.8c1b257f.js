However, in Unity Atoms there is also the possibility to create Responses as Scriptable Objects called Actions. An Action is a function as a Scriptable Object that does not return a value. As a side note there are also Functions in Unity Atoms, which are exactly like Actions, but does return a value. To demonstrate the concept of an Action as a Response lets create an Action called HealthLogger.cs that gives some love to the console and logs the player\u2019s health whenever it changes:","sidebar":"docs"},"tutorials/advanced-example":{"id":"tutorials/advanced-example","title":"Advanced example","description":"See the example scene \\"InfiniteWaves\\" in the example project.","sidebar":"docs"},"tutorials/conditions":{"id":"tutorials/conditions","title":"Conditions","description":"Conditions control whether a listener responds to an event or not.

A Listener listens (sometimes also referred to as observes or subscribes) to an Event and responds by firing off zero to many responses. Listeners are MonoBehaviours and therefore live in a scene.
