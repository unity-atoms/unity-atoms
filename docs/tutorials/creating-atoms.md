# Creating Atoms

There are several ways of creating Atoms in your project. The recommended way is to use the new `Atoms Search` function (introduced in 4.4.2) accessible in the usual Unity `Create` context menu or by pressing the hotkey `Alt + 1`:

Another way to create Atoms is to select `Unity Atoms` in the context menu. The items are listed by category and by type. Custom Atom types created using the `Generator` also appear in this menu (see the dedicated [generator tutorial](./generator.md) for more info on the generator).

In the following tutorials this is simply referred to as "creating an Atom" using any of the above mentioned techniques.
